Python Programming Basics
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to teach fundamental programming concepts, from basic data types to control flow and data structures.

Table of Contents

Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types
Learn about how data is stored and manipulated in Python.

    01_Variable.py: Demonstrates variable assignment and logical operators.
    02_datatype.py: Explains various Python data types including Integers, Floats, Strings, Booleans, and NoneType.
    04_Operators: Covers arithmetic, assignment, comparison, and logical operators with truth tables.
    05_type.py: Shows how to check variable types and perform type casting (e.g., converting a string to a float).
    06_input.py: Explains how to take user input and perform arithmetic operations.
    07_problems.py: Practice problems covering averages, remainders, and squares.

Chapter 3: Strings and String Functions
Explore string manipulation and formatting.

    01_strings.py: Basic string indexing and slicing.
    02_negativeSlicing.py: Advanced slicing techniques, including negative indices and reversing strings.
    03_strFunctions.py: Common string methods (endswith, capitalize) and a comprehensive list of escape sequence characters.
    04_Problems.py: Practical exercises for detecting double spaces, filling letter templates, and formatting text.

Chapter 4: Lists and Tuples
Understand ordered collections and the difference between mutable and immutable types.

    01_list.py: Introduction to lists and their mutability.
    02_methodsofList.py: Demonstrates list methods like append, insert, sort, reverse, pop, and remove.
    03_tuple.py & 04_methodsofTuple.py: Overview of tuples and built-in functions such as count, index, len, max, min, and sum.
    05_problems.py: Exercises for storing user input in lists and verifying tuple immutability.

Chapter 5: Dictionaries and Sets
Master key-value pairs and collections of unique items.

    01_dict.py: Deep dive into dictionary methods like get, update, keys, values, pop, and setdefault.
    02_sets.py: Explains set properties (uniqueness) and methods such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric_difference.
    03_Problems.py: Real-world scenarios, including creating a translation dictionary and handling unique user numbers.

Chapter 6: Conditionals
Learn how to control program flow based on logic.

    01_conditionals.py: Demonstrates if-elif-else ladders and multiple independent if statements.
    02_Problems.py: Logic-building exercises such as finding the greatest of four numbers, grade calculation, and spam detection.

Chapter 7: Loops
Automate repetitive tasks using iteration.

    01_loops.py & 02_while.py: Introduction to for and while loops.
    03_list_using_while.py: Iterating through a list using a while loop.
    04_for.py & 05_for_loop_iterate.py: Using the range() function and iterating over lists, tuples, and strings.
    06_for_with_else.py: Explains the behavior of the else block after a loop completes.

07_break_and_continue.py: Loop control statements to exit or skip iterations.

08_pass.py: Using the pass statement as a null placeholder.
